# Architecture Overview

This application follows a feature-based architecture with core utilities shared across features. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and focused on separation of concerns.

## Design Principles

The architecture is built on these foundational principles:

1. **Feature-First Organization**: Code is organized around business domains/features
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
3. **Core Shared Utilities**: Common functionality is extracted into the core module
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout for better development experience
5. **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and other optimizations
6. **Security First**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection measures
7. **Testing**: Support for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

## Core Module

The `core` module contains shared utilities and components that are used across multiple features:

- **API**: Centralized API client with interceptors and data fetching hooks
- **Auth**: Authentication utilities including token storage and refresh logic
- **Components**: Shared UI components like images, modals, and SEO utilities
- **Router**: Routing configuration and protection guards
- **Storage**: Unified storage API for localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies
- **Utils**: Helper functions including lazy loading utilities

## Features Module

The `features` module contains feature-specific code organized into submodules. Each feature follows a similar structure:

- **API**: Feature-specific API calls
- **Components**: UI components for the feature
- **Hooks**: React hooks specific to the feature
- **Store**: State management for the feature
- **Types**: TypeScript types for the feature
- **Index**: Public API that exposes only what other features need

## State Management

State management is handled at different levels:

- **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state
- **React Context**: For feature-level state sharing
- **Global Store**: For application-wide state (e.g., authentication)

## Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via the auth feature
2. Auth tokens are securely stored in local storage (encrypted)
3. API requests automatically include authentication headers
4. Token expiry is handled with automatic refresh
5. Protected routes verify authentication before rendering

## Routing and Navigation

Routing is handled by React Router with:

- **Route Configuration**: Centralized route definitions
- **Route Guards**: Authentication and role-based protections
- **Lazy Loading**: Routes are loaded on demand for better performance

## Performance Optimizations

Several performance optimizations are implemented:

- **Code Splitting**: Features are loaded on demand
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when needed
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with lazy loading
- **Caching**: API responses are cached with SWR
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations are memoized

## Security Measures

Security is a priority with several measures:

- **Token Encryption**: Auth tokens are encrypted in storage
- **HTTPS Only**: All API requests use HTTPS
- **CSRF Protection**: Protection against cross-site request forgery
- **XSS Protection**: Content security policies and output encoding
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular access control based on user roles
